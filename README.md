# FFMPEG Libraries
This project depends on the FFMPEG libraries for video codecs and other video related functions. These DLL files are automatically installed in the FFMPEG directory located under the applications installation directory.

The application currently uses version 6.1.1 of FFMPEG.

The original DLL files were objtained from the bin directory of the file called ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build-shared.zip. This file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/6.1.1).
