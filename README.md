# FFMPEG Libraries
This project depends on the FFMPEG libraries for video codecs and other video related functions. These DLL files are automatically installed in the FFMPEG directory located under the applications installation directory.

This repository contains the FFMPEG DLL files.

The application currently uses version 7.0.0 of FFMPEG.

The version of the FFMPEG DLL files must match the version of FFMPEG.AutoGen. If FFMPEG.AutoGen is updated, the FFMPEG DLL files in this repository must also be updated.

The best plasce to get the correct version of the FFMPEG DLL files is: https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen/tree/master/FFmpeg/bin/x64.
