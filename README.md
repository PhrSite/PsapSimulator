# Introduction
This project is a Visual Studio Windows Forms application that targets .NET 9. It may be run on Windows 10 or later.

The PsapSimulator application is a test program. The intended uses of this application are:
1. Assist in interoperability testing of Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1) Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) functional elements that deliver NG9-1-1 calls to NG9-1-1 capable Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs).
2. Provide a way to perform integration testing of the various NG9-1-1 interfaces that have been implemented in the [SipLib](https://github.com/PhrSite/SipLib), [Ng911Lib](https://github.com/PhrSite/Ng911Lib), [EidoLib](https://github.com/PhrSite/EidoLib) and [Ng911CadIfLib](https://github.com/PhrSite/Ng911CadIfLib) open source class libraries.
3. Provide a proof of concept implementation of the less commonly implemented interfaces specified in the most recent version of the NENA i3 Standard for Next Generation 9-1-1 Standard (NENA-STA-010.3f).

This application is a simplified PSAP call handling functional element. It is a single call taker position application that can handle multiple calls simultaneously, but the call taker can only communicate with a single caller at a time. There is no centralized PSAP call controller so functions such as automatic call distribution, call queue pickup, call takeover, barge-in, local transfers (within the same PSAP), local conferences, administrative (non-emergency, i.e. an interface to an agency’s PBX) call handling and other functions that are normally expected in a PSAP application will not be available.

The following block diagram shows the NG9-1-1 functional elements that the PsapSimulator application can interface to.

This application currently only handles incoming calls. All calls are treated as NG9-1-1 calls regardless of the origin of the call.

# NG9-1-1 Functional Element Interface Support
Section 4.6 of NENA-STA-010.3f specifies which functional element interfaces that the PSAP call handling functional element must support.

The following table shows which interfaces and the degree of support that this application provides. The degree of support is indicated in the “Supported?” column. The "Implemented?" column indicates if the interface has been implemented in the current version of the software.

| NENA-STA-010.3f Section | Supported? | Implemented? | Description |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 4.6.1 SIP Call Interface | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.2 Media | Full Support | Yes | This application supports multimedia calls with any combination of audio, video, Real Time Text (RTT) and MSRP text |
| 4.6.3 LoST Interface | Full Support | No |   |
| 4.6.4 LIS Interfaces | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.5 Bridge Interface | Yes | Yes | This section of NENA-STA-010.3f states that the PSAP MAY provide its own conference bridge. The PsapSimulator application does not provide its own conference bridge but it does support call conferencing and call transfers via an external conference aware user agent (i.e. a conference bridge). |
| 4.6.6 Element State | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.7 Service State | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.8 Abandoned Call Event | No | No | Future |
| 4.6.9 De-queue Registration | Full Support | No |  |
| 4.6.10 Queue State | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.11 SI | No | No | Support for the Spatial Interface of a GIS server is optional in NENA-STA-010.3f. |
| 4.6.12 Logging Service | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.13 Security Posture | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.14 Policy | No | No | Support for the Policy Store is optional in NENA-STA-010.3f. |
| 4.6.15 Additional Data Dereference | Full Support | No |  |
| 4.6.16 Time Interface | Yes | No | Via the Windows NTP Interface |
| 4.6.17 Test Call | Full Support | Yes |  |
| 4.6.18 Testing of Policy Rules | No | No | Support for this function is optional in NENA-STA-010.3f. |
| 4.6.19 Call Diversion | Yes | No | Because De-Queue Registration will be supported. Element State, Service State and Queue state are already implemented. |

# Dependancies

2. Ng911Lib (2.0.0)
3. Ng911CadIfLib (1.2.0)

## FFMPEG Libraries
This project depends on the FFMPEG libraries for video codecs and other video related functions. These DLL files are automatically installed in the FFMPEG directory located under the applications installation directory.

This project contains the FFMPEG DLL files that it needs in the FFMPEG directory. These DLL files are distrubuted automatically when the project is published.

The application currently uses version 7.0.0 of FFMPEG. The version of the FFMPEG DLL files must match the version of FFMPEG.AutoGen. If FFMPEG.AutoGen is updated, the FFMPEG DLL files in this repository must also be updated.

The best place to get the correct version of the FFMPEG DLL files is: https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen/tree/master/FFmpeg/bin/x64.

# Building an Installation File
The steps to build an installation file for the PsapSimulator application are:
1. Open the PsapSimulator.sln solution in Visual Studio, open the project properties and change the Assembly version and the File version.
2. Select Release build and build the project.
3. Publish the project
4. Open the PsapSimulatorSetup solution
5. Make sure that all of the files in the PsapSimulator/Publish directory are included in the Application Folder.
6. Make sure that the Release build is selected.
7. Modify the Version in the project properties. Visual Studio will prompt you to change the Product Code. Select Yes.
8. Build the project. 
9. Build a self-extracting EXE file as described in the following section.

## Creating a Self-Extracting EXE Installation File
The Windows iexpress application can be used to build a self-extracting EXE file from the setup.exe and the PsapSimulator.msi files produced by the PsapSimulatorSetup project.

The PsapSimulatorSetup directory contains a configuration file for iexpress called PsapSimulator.SED.

The iexpress application does not support relative file paths so this file must be modified as follows.

1. Modify the TargetName property (shown highlighted below) to specify the path of the output EXE file for the path on the development computer that you are using.
2. Change the version number of the PsapSimulatorX.X.X.exe file name in the TargetName property to the correct release version. 
3. Modify the SourceFiles0 property (shown highlighted below) to specify the path to the source files for the path on the development computer that you are using. 

Once the PsapSimulator.SED file has been modified and saved, you can use it with iexpress to produce a self-extracting EXE file by following these steps:
1. Open a command prompt window
1. Type: iexpress
1. Select Open existing Self Extraction Directive file
1. Browse to the PsapSimulatorSetup directory and select the PsapSimulator.SED file
1. Click on the Next button
1. Make sure that the Create Package option is selected and click on Next

The PsapSimulatorX.X.X.exe file will be created in the InstallationPackages directory.
