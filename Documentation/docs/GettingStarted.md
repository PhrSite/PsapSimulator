# Getting Started

# Installation
The InstallationPackages directory located below the PsapSimulator GitHub repository contains a self-extracting EXE file called PsapSimulatorX.X.X.exe. "X.X.X" indicates the software version of the application.

The installation file is downloaded when you clone or get the PsapSimulator GitHub repository. You can also download just this EXE file from the GitHub repository by using GitHub's file download function.

Once the self-extracting EXE file is downloaded to your computer, you can install the application by running the EXE file.

**Note:** You must be a local Windows administrator to install this application.

The installation program will install a shortcut on your Windows desktop.

# Basic Operations
Double-click on the shortcut called "PsapSimulator" on your computer's desktop to run the application.

When the PsapSimulator application is launched it does not start listening for calls.

Click on the Start button to enable call handling. It may take 4 or 5 seconds for the application to start up its interfaces the first time that you click on the Start button after launching the application.

## Answering a Call
When the application receives a call request, it lists the call in the call list display area of the main window.

Click on the Answer button to answer the call. Answering a call does not automatically display the [Call Window](CallForm.md) for the call.

Double-click on the call in the call list display to show the Call Window. The Call Window allows you to fully interact with the caller using audio, video and text messaging.

## Ending a Call
To end a call from the Main Window, select the call from the call list and click on the End Call button.

To end a call from the Call Window, click on the End Call button.

If the caller ends the call, the application will automatically remove if from the call list.

## Exiting the Application
The Close button causes the application to exit.

If the Close button is disabled, click on the "Stop" button and then click on Close.

**Note:** The "X" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the Main Window is disabled by the software so you must use the Close button to close this application.

## Changing Configuration Settings
The application has default configuration settings that will allow you to use it immediately after it is installed on your computer.

You can view and change the configuration settings by clicking on the Settings button in the Main Window.

If the Settings button is disabled, then click on the "Stop" button, then click on Settings.
